# AHK CapsLock Navigation & Media Shortcuts

## 📌 What is AutoHotkey (AHK)?  
**AutoHotkey** is a free and open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, primarily designed to provide easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation to allow users of most computer skill levels to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application.

## Pain Point
My keyboard **doesn't have arrow keys** and is also **missing some media keys**, so I thought I could use Caps Lock in combination with other keys. 
I created this script to fit my needs. **You can modify this script** according to your own requirements.

## 🚀 How This Script Works  
Since my keyboard **doesn't have arrow keys**, I have mapped Caps Lock as a modifier key to replace arrow keys:  

| **Shortcut** | **Action** |
|-------------|-----------|
| `CapsLock + I` | Move **Up** (↑) |
| `CapsLock + K` | Move **Down** (↓) |
| `CapsLock + J` | Move **Left** (←) |
| `CapsLock + L` | Move **Right** (→) |
| `CapsLock + ;` | Move **Right** (→) |
| `CapsLock + Win + P` | Take a Screenshot (Print Screen) |
| `CapsLock + Backspace` | Delete Key |
| `CapsLock + 1` | Mute Volume |
| `CapsLock + 2` | Decrease Volume |
| `CapsLock + 3` | Increase Volume |


👉 IKJL is somewhat similar to WSAD, which we commonly use for playing games.

## 🛠 How to Use This Script  

### **Option 1: Run the Script Directly**
1. **Install AutoHotkey** from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).  
2. Download this script and **double-click** to run it.  

### **Option 2: Convert to an EXE File**  
If you don’t want to install AHK, you can convert this script into an **EXE file**:  
1. Install AutoHotkey.  
2. Right-click the `.ahk` file and select **"Compile Script"**.  
3. This will generate an `.exe` file that you can run without AutoHotkey.  

Alternatively, you can **directly download the pre-compiled `.exe` file** from the folder I have provided.

## 🔄 Add Script to Startup (Optional)  
To make the script run **automatically** every time you start your computer:  
1. **Press** `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and hit **Enter**.  
2. **Copy the `.exe` file** (or the `.ahk` script) into this folder.  
3. The script will now **run automatically** on startup!

## 📂 Download  
If you don't want to compile the script yourself, you can **directly download the EXE file** from the folder I have provided.

## 📝 Notes  
- **Caps Lock functionality is not affected**; it still works normally for typing uppercase letters.  
- You can modify the script to **customize shortcuts** as needed.  
- To stop the script, right-click the **AHK icon in the system tray** and select **Exit**.
