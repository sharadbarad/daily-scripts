# AHK CapsLock Navigation & Media Shortcuts

This **AutoHotkey (AHK) script** allows you to use **Caps Lock** as a modifier key to replace arrow keys and add media controls, making navigation easier on keyboards that **lack arrow keys**. You can also use this script to create an executable file (`.exe`) and add it to the startup folder for automatic execution.

## 📌 What is AutoHotkey (AHK)?  
**AutoHotkey (AHK)** is a scripting language for automating tasks on Windows. It allows you to create custom keyboard shortcuts, remap keys, and automate repetitive actions.

## 🚀 How This Script Works  
Since my keyboard **doesn't have arrow keys**, I have mapped Caps Lock as a modifier key to replace arrow keys:  

| **Shortcut** | **Action** |
|-------------|-----------|
| `CapsLock + I` | Move **Up** (↑) |
| `CapsLock + K` | Move **Down** (↓) |
| `CapsLock + J` | Move **Left** (←) |
| `CapsLock + L` | Move **Right** (→) |
| `CapsLock + ;` | Move **Right** (→) |
| `CapsLock + P` | Take a Screenshot (Print Screen) |
| `CapsLock + Backspace` | Delete Key |
| `CapsLock + 1` | Mute Volume |
| `CapsLock + 2` | Decrease Volume |
| `CapsLock + 3` | Increase Volume |
