# Modified Files Tracker

## 📌 Overview
This Python script helps users find files that have been modified after a specified date and time within a given directory and its subdirectories. It also provides the flexibility to exclude specific folders from the search and saves the list of modified files in a text file (`modified_files.txt`).


## 🎯 Use Cases
- **Backup Management**: Identify newly modified files to back up only what's necessary.
